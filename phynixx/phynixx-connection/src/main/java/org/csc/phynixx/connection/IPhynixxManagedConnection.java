/**
 * a managed connection is managed by the phynixx system.

 * this IF combines the role of a core connection and the role of a connection proxy.

 * h1. Thread Safeness
 *
 * When this connection is used in a pool ({@link org.csc.phynixx.connection.PooledPhynixxManagedConnectionFactory} it is strongly recommend to synchronized
 * the connection {@link #setSynchronized(boolean)}.
 *
 * When a connection is get from the pool or if it is released to it some functionality of the connection is used.
 * It is no obvious if the pools implementation of {@link org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool} is strictly thread safe.
